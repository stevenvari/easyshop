# easyshop E-Commerce API Phase 1 and 2

This is an application called easyshop, it has two parts: the backend and the user interface, it is created with Java, MySQL and we use Postman for testing, for the backend, it uses Sprint Boot. The controller part I added the correct annotations that were needed, in the productDAO I fixed a bug that had problems filtering the product search and there was another one in update.
